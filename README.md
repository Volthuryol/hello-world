# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.

My name is Caden, I am an aspiring Software Engineer from rural Kentucky. I have some previous experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SWIFT, AGILE enviornments, GIT, and API's.
I am looking forward to learning more in Python and hopefully find a good mentor to help mold me into a great Programmer.
Aside from Software, I like hiking, have a passion for animals, really enjoy movies, games, and comedy.
